## Description
_Global Web Newspaper_ is an online news platform that offers you quick and easy access to the latest news in various categories, from sports, technology, science, etc. My mission is to provide you with up-to-date information in a convenient manner. It is a non-profit project with educational reasons. You can easily search for articles on topics of interest to you, and go directly to the official article in The New York Times to read it. I must confess that the weeks it took me to develop this project were incredible, as I am still learning and strengthening my knowledge, there were moments, in fact days, in which I got stuck in logic errors or errors with the handling of TypeScript and believe me I do not regret it. . My mentality in software development and in life is *‚Äúfight until the last drop of blood‚Äù*, I feel that the ability to tell myself ‚ÄúKeep working‚Äù whenever I feel like I can't take it anymore, will help me grow and become a Software engineer who is an expert in the technologies that I have to learn, to integrate into the skills kit.


- What was his motivation?

     I read somewhere that the best way to learn how to develop software and create scalable solutions is by developing small projects as you learn. My main motivation is my desire for growth, perhaps the code of this WebApp is not perfect but thanks to it I learned a lot of things, things that push me to continue learning other things, and that will be the case, until I become a Software Engineer.

- Why did you develop this project?

     First of all, one of the reasons why I decided to develop this project was for learning reasons. I remember that I had finished a basic TypeScript course, and I said to myself, you know, why don't you develop a WepApp based on TypeScript? It won't be easy because it is something new but you will learn a lot. I followed my advice, and this is the result.
    
- What did you learn?

     The first thing I learned was that in one week I was not going to be able to build the site. üòÜ
     All kidding aside, I was able to work closely and experiment in many ways with a REST API [Nytimes](https://developer.nytimes.com/). I was able to integrate it into the project and get it to work properly in the WebApp. I was able to get closer to Bootstrap and take a closer look at everything that can be done, using a library like that. I was also able to experiment with the Responsive design, to make the app visually pleasant on mobile devices. I learned so much that if I continued, the answer to this question would be quite extensive. ü§¶

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine using Git:
    
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/TuUsuario/Global-Web-Newspaper.git
     ```

     Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

     If you don't have it installed, I recommend installing it. For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

2. Open terminal.
    
     You can use apt package manager to install Node.js. For LTS version you can use the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
     ```

3. You also need to install npm separately:

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install -y npm
     ```

4. navigate to the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd Global-Web-Newspaper
     ```

5. Install the dependencies of the project using npm:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

6. Make sure you have TypeScript globally installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

7. Compile the TypeScript project to JavaScript:

     ```bash
     tsc
     ```

8. You can now run the app locally:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

To use the app, simply open your web browser and go to the URL where the app is running locally. You can then search for news in different categories and click on the links to read the full articles on the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) website.
